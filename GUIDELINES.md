# Node.js Challenge

## Assignment
The goal of this exercise is to create a simple API with Node.js, using or not any framework of your choice, to allow users to query
[stock quotes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockquote.asp). It is scaffolded with two Express apps, but you can
use another backend Node.js framework of your preference.

The project consists of two separate services:
* A user-facing API that will receive requests from registered users asking for quote information. 
* An internal stock service that queries external APIs to retrieve the requested quote information.

## Minimum requirements
### API service
* Endpoints in the API service should require authentication (no anonymous requests should be allowed). Each request
  should be authenticated via Basic Authentication.
  * To register a user the API service must receive a request with an email address and return a randomized password,
    like this:

    Request example:

    `POST /register`
    ```
      { "email": "johndoe@contoso.com", "password": "bda5d07453dfde4440803cfcdec48d92" }
    ```

* When a user requests a stock quote (calls the stock endpoint in the api service), if it exists, it should be saved and
  related to that user in the database.
  * The response returned by the API service should be like this:
  
    `GET /stock?q=aapl.us`
    ```
      {
      "name": "APPLE",
      "symbol": "AAPL.US",
      "open": 123.66,
      "high": 123.66,
      "low": 122.49,
      "close": 123
      }
    ```
  
  * A user can get their history of queries made to the api service by hitting the history endpoint. The endpoint should
    return the list of entries saved in the database, showing the latest entries first:
    
    `GET /history`
    ```
    [
        {"date": "2021-04-01T19:20:30Z", "name": "APPLE", "symbol": "AAPL.US", "open": "123.66", "high": 123.66, "low": 122.49, "close": "123"},
        {"date": "2021-03-25T11:10:55Z", "name": "APPLE", "symbol": "AAPL.US", "open": "121.10", "high": 123.66, "low": 122, "close": "122"},
        ...
    ]
    ```
* A super user (and only super users) can hit the stats endpoint, which will return the top 5 most requested stocks:

  `GET /stats`
  ```
  [
      {"stock": "aapl.us", "times_requested": 5},
      {"stock": "msft.us", "times_requested": 2},
      ...
  ]
  ```
* All endpoint responses should be in JSON format.

### Stock service
* Assume this is an internal service, so requests to endpoints in this service don't need to be authenticated.
* When a stock request is received, this service should query an external API to get the stock information. For this
  challenge, use this API: `https://stooq.com/q/l/?s={stock_code}&f=sd2t2ohlcvn&h&e=csv`.
* Note that `{stock_code}` above is a parameter that should be replaced with the requested stock code.
* You can see a list of available stock codes here: https://stooq.com/t/?i=518

## Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](art/architecture.png)
1. A user makes a request asking for Nasdaq's current Stock quote: `GET /stock?q=ndq`
2. The API service calls the stock service to retrieve the requested stock information
3. The stock service delegates the call to the external API, parses the response, and returns the information back to the API service.
4. The API service saves the response from the stock service in the database.
5. The data is formatted and returned to the user.

## Bonuses
The following features are optional to implement, but if you do, you'll be ranked higher in our evaluation process.
* Add unit tests for the services.
* Add contract/integration tests for the API service.
* Use JWT instead of basic authentication for endpoints.
* Use containers to orchestrate the services.
* Use OpenAPI/Swagger to document the API.
* Add endpoint to reset user password sending an email with the new password.

## How to run the project
* Install dependencies: `cd api-service; npm install` and `cd stock-service; npm install`
* Start the api service: `node api-service`
* Start the stock service: `node stock-service`

__Important:__ If your implementation requires different steps to start the services
(like starting a rabbitMQ consumer), document them in the Readme!
